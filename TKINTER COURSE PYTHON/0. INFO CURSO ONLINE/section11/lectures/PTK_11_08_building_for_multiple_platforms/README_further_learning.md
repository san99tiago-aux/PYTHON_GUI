# Further learning

I strongly recommend reading through the official documentation, particularly these sections:

- https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operating-mode.html
- https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#options
- https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#supporting-multiple-platforms
- https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#platform-specific-notes
- https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/runtime-information.html
- https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec-files.html
- https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/when-things-go-wrong.html

I know it's quite a lot, but it'll be worth it!

In addition, remember the documentation has more sections on advanced topics that you can read if you think you may need those.

Finally, there's also a [recipes page](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Recipes) that contains code to do specific things with PyInstaller, such as getting an executable from a Django app, or one to do multiprocessing. These code samples and common issues will reduce the amount of work you have to do when trying to get something like this working.
