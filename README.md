# TKINTER WITH PYTHON :cyclone:

The main objective of this project, is to achieve a basic understanding of the Tkinter library and
the implementation of simple projects that can be used to create more complex and interesting solutions.
This repository is based on a tkinter course from "Udemy".


## Dependencies :vertical_traffic_light:
The dependencies are mainly python libraries and the correct usage of them. < br />
My advice is to primary understand the "pip" package installer, before working with other dependencies.


### Software dependencies
* VS Code <br />
Visual Studio Code is the main code editor for all files related to servers and high-level programming. This is not absolutely necessary, but from my experience, it gives us a great performance and we can link it with Git and Github easily.
```

```


* Python <br />
Python is the main programming language that let us work fast, with easy and powerful integration of different software solutions.
```

```



### Libraries and Package dependencies
* TKINTER <br />
Tkinter is an integrated Library that gives us a great way to create GUI windows with Python. It is also a cross-platform that has the 
advantage of working with the classic Tk windows and many libraries that integrate together to achieve amazing projects.

```
* PILLOW <br />
Pillow is an integrated library for tkinter, that enables the usage of images and work with them in a simpler way.
```

```

* PYINSTALLER <br />
Pyinstaller is a simple and effective way to generate executable files based on the applications developed in python language.
It gives us a lot of variations, and production options. It's important to look for its documentation for the correct usage.

## Usage :pencil2:
All projects are really well commented and most of them have specifications and remarks for their purpose.

I will be uploading most of the files, and try to keep it as clean as possible.


## Special thanks :gift:
* Thanks to my university professor: <Santiago Mendez>
* Thanks to all contributors for the great OpenSource projects that I am using.
